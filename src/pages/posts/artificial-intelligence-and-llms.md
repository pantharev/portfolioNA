# Exploring AI and Automation Possibilities

I'm starting to gain an interest in **AI** and its use cases more and more each day as I learn more about it. I've been learning about **LLMs** and its use cases and how I can apply it to my projects.

One of the goals I have is to create **agents** that can help me or others with task automation. For example, having agents that can automate the process of creating a website, or creating analytic dashboards from data.

If this can be done, then it could bring value not just to me but to others as well.
