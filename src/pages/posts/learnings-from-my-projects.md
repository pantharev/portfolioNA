# Creating & Learning - My Development Journey

I've noticed that I take an interest in **creating new things** and showcasing them. Whether it be to my family or friends, clients, or just for myself. I enjoy creating new things and learning new things. This may be due to my curiosity and desire to learn new things, or it may be due to my desire to create something that I can be proud of.

I can dig deep into the **design aspect** and the **code**, get into the flow of creating the application, whether it be a simple CRUD app such as an admin dashboard, or a complex app with logic in the **SQL back-end**. 

I take pride in creating and applying all the knowledge I've obtained when learning and developing new projects. It lets me know of how far I've come and how much further I can go. By having this constant drive of learning and doing, I really think the possibilities of being able to create well-developed and interesting applications for me are **endless**.
