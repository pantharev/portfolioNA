# Professional Web Development Journey

I learned to use **SQL Server**, **NodeJs**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery** in a professional setting. I created widgets, check-in forms, a calendar, student-to-faculty mentor assignment CRUD operations, and assisted with reports for student grades and faculty.

This was achieved using minimal frameworks and libraries to prevent updates from breaking the website.

Additionally, I developed a new framework while on the job that utilizes **Handlebars.js** and **rxjs** to enable dynamic re-rendering of the page without needing a full refresh. A link to the framework can be found here: [Reactive Handlebars](#).

I also learned to use **SSIS** to create ETL tasks that transfer data via APIs using **Python** and **C#** to our data warehouse.
