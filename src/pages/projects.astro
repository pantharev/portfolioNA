    description: "This was made using NextJs, TailwindCSS, and AWS. It is a web application that allows users to create and view user generated AI creations. Whether it be images, music, film, or videos. All within a featured page with likes/comments, and user profiles pages for each user. With the goal also being to allow users to sell their creations and have a marketplace for AI creations to buy and sell from each other. Note that there will be monitary gains for me from this project, but it is a project that I am passionate about and want to see it come to life.",
